merge sort
	O(nlog(n))
	O(log(n)) step is when half the array
	O(n) step is the helper merge method

subsets
	2^n
	iterative, creating a new subarray on each step and looping through
	
permutations
	n!
	the output is n! of the input

require "benchmark" gem
	can output a report on how fast an algo is running
	Benchark.bm do |b|
		b.report("1,000: ") { small.sort }
	end
